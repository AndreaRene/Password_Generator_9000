# Password Generator 9000

In this application I wanted to create a password generator found [here](https://andrearene.github.io/Password_Generator_9000/) that met the following criteria:

* A generator that creates random passwords 
* An interface that give the user the ability to specify length and character types used
* A required length of at least 8 and no more than 128 characters
* The option to use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers
* A requirement that the user select at least one of the character options
* Data validation, error handling, and functionality that will loop the user back into the process exactly where the mistake was made (if a mistake is made) instead of having to start over
* A simple and clean interface with a responsive design that accomodates screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px

## Technology Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Miro canvas platform for planning/flow charting (see screen capture below)
